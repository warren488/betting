## Tech choices

I decided to use a framework so that I could move more quickly to achieve the tasks required in the test.
I chose Vue as it gave me a good starting point using the vue-cli which has the option to include routing and
state management modules from the setup. As much as possible I tried not to lean on the framework and instead solve the problem that instead demonstrates my understanding of web development in general.
The project was created using node `16.4.2`

## Project setup

```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development

```
npm run serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production

```
npm run build
```

### Lints and fixes files

```
npm run lint
```
